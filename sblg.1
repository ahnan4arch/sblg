.Sh NAME
.Nm sblg
.Nd simple off-line blog utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sblg
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl o Ar file
.Op Fl t Ar templ
.Op Fl ac
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility knits together an XML article with a template to create
standalone pages or a collection of articles with a template to create a
.Qq blog
or Atom feed
amalgamation.
HTML is assumed only with the default suffix re-write rule standalone
articles; input and output may in fact be arbitrary XML mark-up.
Input articles may be XML fragments or full documents: only the
.Aq article data-sblg-article="1"
tree within the article is considered.
.Pp
The calling conventions follow that of
.Xr cc 1
for easier integration with
.Xr make 1 :
specifying
.Fl c
produces a stand-alone article page from an input file and template.
Not specifying
.Fl c
will link together articles (fragments or as previously run through
.Fl c )
to create a blog amalgamation.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar file
When creating an amalgamation, this fills a single
.Aq article data-sblg-article="1"
element with
.Ar file ,
which also must appear in the input list.
This is useful when creating pages with
.Aq nav data-sblg-nav="1" ,
but with a single specific article.
The argument is ignored when combined with
.Fl a
or
.Fl c .
.It Fl o Ar file
Output file.
If unspecified, standalone articles have
.Li .html
appended to the input file name, unless the input file extension is
.Li .xml ,
in which case the
.Li .xml
is replaced by
.Li .html .
If multiple input files are specified,
.Fl o
is ignored.
If unspecified for the blog amalgamation,
.Ar blog.html
is used by default.
If unspecified for the Atom feed amalgamation,
.Ar atom.xml
is used by default.
Use
.Fl o Ar \-
for standard output.
.It Fl t Ar templ
Template for standalone or amalgamation files.
If unspecified, defaults to
.Ar article-template.xml
for
.Fl c ,
.Ar atom-template.xml
for
.Fl a ,
and
.Ar blog-template.xml
otherwise.
.It Fl a
Creates an Atom feed amalgamation from its input files.
.It Fl c
Create standalone articles instead of merging together articles into an
amalgamation.
.It Ar
Input files.
In standalone mode with
.Fl c ,
input XML files are merged with a template into an output file.
Otherwise, multiple input files are merged into a single amalgamation.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
creates a
.Qq blog
amalgamation
.Pa blog.html
from one or more input files using
.Pa blog-template.xml
as the template file.
.Ss Article Input
Article input files consist of XML fragments or whole documents.
They must at least consist of the following within the document:
.Bd -literal
<article data-sblg-article="1">
  <header>
    <h1>Article Name</h1>
    <address>Author Name</address>
    <time datetime="2013-06-29">29 June, 2013</time>
  </header>
  <aside>
    This is used as a feed <b>summary</b>.
  </aside>
  <p>Some text.</p>
</article>
.Ed
.Pp
When processed with
.Nm ,
all data outside of the
.Aq article data-sblg-article="1"
element is discarded.
Then the article title is extracted from the first
.Aq hn
.Pq header 1\(en4
within the
.Aq header ,
article publication date is extracted from the first
.Aq time ,
and author from the first
.Aq address .
If the
.Aq article
tag has an
.Li data-sblg-tags
attribute consisting of space-separated tag names, these tags are
extracted for tag operation.
.Pp
If unspecified, the default article title is
.Qq Untitled article ,
the default author is the
.Qq Unknown author ,
the publication time is set to the document's file-system creation time,
and no tags.
.Pp
The first
.Aq aside ,
if provided, is used for the feed summary.
All content is recorded in case the
.Li data-sblg-content
Boolean value is used in an Atom feed.
.Ss Standalone Template
The standalone template file must be a well-formed XML file where the
first
.Aq article data-sblg-article="1"
element is replaced by the article text.
All of this element's children are removed.
.Bd -literal
<body>
  <header>This consists of a single blog entry.</header>
  <article>This is kept.</article>
  <article data-sblg-article="1">This is removed.</article>
  <footer>Something.</footer>
</body>
.Ed
.Pp
The template's
.Aq title
element has the input article's title prepended to any existing content.
.Ss Blog Amalgamation Template
The amalgamation template file must also be a well-formed XML file where
each
.Aq article data-sblg-article="1"
element is replaced by ordered (newest to oldest) article text.
If there aren't enough articles, the element is removed.
Furthermore, any
.Aq nav data-sblg-nav="1"
elements are replaced by a list of all available articles in an
unordered list consisting of article dates followed by the title, linked
to the page itself.
.Po
.Em Note :
if you're running
.Fl o
with XML files, the linked file will consist of an XML target, not
an HTML target.
.Pc
.Pp
The Boolean
.Li data-sbgl-navcontent
attribute makes the content of the
.Aq nav
element be reproduced within each list item, with the special string
.Li ${base} ,
.Li ${date} ,
.Li ${source} ,
.Li ${aside} ,
and
.Li ${title}
being replaced by the article's basename (i.e., filename with suffix
chopped off), publication date, filename, aside content, and title,
respectively.
.Em Note :
the aside is not HTML-encoded, so tags appearing in the aside will
appear unmodified in the output.
If the
.Aq nav
element contains a positive integer
.Li data-sblg-navsz
attribute, this is used to limit the number of navigation entries.
Finally, if the
.Li data-sblg-navtag
is specified, only articles with matching tags are shown.
Tags are extracted from the space-separated
.Li data-sblg-tags
element of each article's topmost
.Aq article
element.
.Bd -literal
<body>
  <header>This consists of two blog entries.</header>
  <nav data-sblg-nav="1" />
  <article data-sblg-article="1" />
  <article data-sblg-article="1" />
  <footer>Something.</footer>
</body>
.Ed
.Pp
Each
.Aq article
will be followed by a
.Pq permanent link
anchor within a
.Aq div
with the custom class
.Qq data-sblg-permlink
unless a Boolean
.Qq data-sblg-permlink
attribute is set to false.
.Ss Atom Amalgamation Template
The Atom template file must be a well-formed XML file where each
.Aq entry
element with a Boolean
.Li data-sblg-entry
attribute is replaced by ordered (newest to oldest) article information.
If there aren't enough articles, the element is removed.
.Bd -literal
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
  <title>Example Feed</title>
  <link href="http://example.org/feed/" rel="self" />
  <link href="http://example.org/" />
  <updated data-sblg-updated="1" />
  <id data-sblg-id="1" />
  <entry data-sblg-entry="1" />
  <entry data-sblg-entry="1" />
  <entry data-sblg-entry="1" />
</feed>
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Aq updated
element with a Boolean
.Li data-sblg-updated
attribute is replaced with the newest article date (or the current date,
if no articles are listed).
The
.Aq id
element with a Boolean
.Li data-sblg-id
attributed is replaced with an identifier in the form of
.Li tag:domain,2013:path ,
where the domain is initialised to the current domain or extracted from
the
.Aq link
to the self.
The path is also extracted from the self
.Aq link ,
initialised to the root path
.Sq \&/ .
.Pp
Each
.Aq entry
element with a Boolean
.Li data-sblg-entry
attribute is filled in with a
.Aq title ,
.Aq id
.Pq in tag format ,
.Aq author ,
HTML
.Aq summary
.Pq if specified in the article as an Ao aside Ac ,
and alternate
.Aq link .
If the
.Ar entry
element contains a false
.Li data-sblg-altlink
Boolean attribute, the alternate
.Aq link
is not printed.
Furthermore, if a true
.Li data-sblg-content
Boolean attribute exists, the article's contents (everything within the
.Aq article data-sblg-article="1" )
are inlined within a
.Aq content
element with type
.Li html .
